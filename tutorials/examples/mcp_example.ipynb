Online ahead of print.\\n\\nEarly-Onset Gastrointestinal Cancers: A Review.\\n\\nJayakrishnan T(1), Ng K(1).\\n\\nAuthor information:\\n(1)Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, \\nMassachusetts.\\n\\nIMPORTANCE: Early-onset gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is typically defined as GI \\ncancer diagnosed in individuals younger than 50 years. The incidence of \\nearly-onset GI cancer is rising globally, and early-onset GI cancers represent \\nthe most rapidly increasing early-onset cancer in the US.\\nOBSERVATIONS: Worldwide, among early-onset GI cancers reported in 2022, \\ncolorectal cancer (CRC) was the most common (54.3%; 184 709 cases), followed by \\ngastric cancer (23.8%; 80 885 cases), esophageal cancer (13.2%; 45 056 cases), \\nand pancreatic cancer (8.6%; 29 402 cases). In the US, among early-onset GI \\ncancers reported in 2022, 20 805 individuals were diagnosed with early-onset \\nCRC, 2689 with early-onset gastric, 2657 with early-onset pancreatic, and 875 \\nwith early-onset esophageal cancer. Most early-onset GI cancers are associated \\nwith modifiable risk factors including obesity, poor-quality diet (eg, \\nsugar-sweetened beverages, ultraprocessed foods), sedentary lifestyle, cigarette \\nsmoking, and alcohol consumption. Nonmodifiable risk factors include family \\nhistory, hereditary syndromes (eg, Lynch syndrome), and inflammatory bowel \\ndisease for patients with early-onset CRC. Approximately 15% to 30% of \\nearly-onset GI cancers have pathogenic germline variants in genes such as DNA \\nmismatch repair genes and BRCA1/2. All patients with early-onset GI cancers \\nshould undergo germline and somatic genetic testing to guide treatment, screen \\nfor other cancers (eg, endometrial cancer in Lynch syndrome), and assess \\nfamilial risk. Treatment for early-onset GI cancers are similar to later-onset \\nGI cancers and may include chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, and therapies such \\nas poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors for BRCA-associated \\npancreatic cancer. Compared with GI cancers diagnosed after age 50 years, \\npatients with early-onset GI cancers typically receive more treatments but often \\nhave similar or shorter survival. Specialized centers and multidisciplinary \\nteams can support patients with challenges around fertility preservation, \\nparenting with cancer, financial difficulty, and psychosocial distress. \\nCurrently, screening is not recommended for most early-onset GI cancers, \\nalthough in the US, screening for CRC is recommended for average-risk \\nindividuals starting at age 45 years. High-risk individuals (eg, those with \\nLynch syndrome, a first-degree relative with CRC, or advanced colorectal \\nadenoma) should begin CRC screening earlier, at an age determined by the \\nspecific risk factor.\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early-onset GI cancers, typically defined as cancer \\ndiagnosed in individuals younger than 50 years, are among the largest subset of \\nearly-onset cancers globally. Treatment is similar to later-onset GI cancers and \\ntypically involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, \\ndepending on the cancer type and stage. The prognosis for patients with \\nearly-onset GI cancers is similar to or worse than that for patients with \\nlater-onset GI cancers, highlighting the need for improved methods of prevention \\nand early detection.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1001/jama.2025.10218\\nPMID: 40674064\",\"annotations\":null,\"meta\":null}\n",

Accordingly, such individuals should be considered for \\\\nmenopausal hormone therapy to improve quality of life and to decrease health \\\\nrisks associated with premature menopause. Given emerging data on the potential \\\\nof estrogen-only therapy to reduce breast cancer risk, clinicians caring for \\\\nwomen with BRCA1/2 mutations could consider offering hysterectomy along with BSO \\\\nas part of risk-reducing surgery.\\\\n\\\\nCopyright © 2025 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \\\\nPublished by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Online ahead of print.\\\\n\\\\nEarly-Onset Gastrointestinal Cancers: A Review.\\\\n\\\\nJayakrishnan T(1), Ng K(1).\\\\n\\\\nAuthor information:\\\\n(1)Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, \\\\nMassachusetts.\\\\n\\\\nIMPORTANCE: Early-onset gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is typically defined as GI \\\\ncancer diagnosed in individuals younger than 50 years. The incidence of \\\\nearly-onset GI cancer is rising globally, and early-onset GI cancers represent \\\\nthe most rapidly increasing early-onset cancer in the US.\\\\nOBSERVATIONS: Worldwide, among early-onset GI cancers reported in 2022, \\\\ncolorectal cancer (CRC) was the most common (54.3%; 184\\u202f709 cases), followed by \\\\ngastric cancer (23.8%; 80\\u202f885 cases), esophageal cancer (13.2%; 45\\u202f056 cases), \\\\nand pancreatic cancer (8.6%; 29\\u202f402 cases). In the US, among early-onset GI \\\\ncancers reported in 2022, 20\\u202f805 individuals were diagnosed with early-onset \\\\nCRC, 2689 with early-onset gastric, 2657 with early-onset pancreatic, and 875 \\\\nwith early-onset esophageal cancer. Most early-onset GI cancers are associated \\\\nwith modifiable risk factors including obesity, poor-quality diet (eg, \\\\nsugar-sweetened beverages, ultraprocessed foods), sedentary lifestyle, cigarette \\\\nsmoking, and alcohol consumption. Nonmodifiable risk factors include family \\\\nhistory, hereditary syndromes (eg, Lynch syndrome), and inflammatory bowel \\\\ndisease for patients with early-onset CRC. Approximately 15% to 30% of \\\\nearly-onset GI cancers have pathogenic germline variants in genes such as DNA \\\\nmismatch repair genes and BRCA1/2. All patients with early-onset GI cancers \\\\nshould undergo germline and somatic genetic testing to guide treatment, screen \\\\nfor other cancers (eg, endometrial cancer in Lynch syndrome), and assess \\\\nfamilial risk. Treatment for early-onset GI cancers are similar to later-onset \\\\nGI cancers and may include chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, and therapies such \\\\nas poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors for BRCA-associated \\\\npancreatic cancer. Compared with GI cancers diagnosed after age 50 years, \\\\npatients with early-onset GI cancers typically receive more treatments but often \\\\nhave similar or shorter survival. Specialized centers and multidisciplinary \\\\nteams can support patients with challenges around fertility preservation, \\\\nparenting with cancer, financial difficulty, and psychosocial distress. \\\\nCurrently, screening is not recommended for most early-onset GI cancers, \\\\nalthough in the US, screening for CRC is recommended for average-risk \\\\nindividuals starting at age 45 years. High-risk individuals (eg, those with \\\\nLynch syndrome, a first-degree relative with CRC, or advanced colorectal \\\\nadenoma) should begin CRC screening earlier, at an age determined by the \\\\nspecific risk factor.\\\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early-onset GI cancers, typically defined as cancer \\\\ndiagnosed in individuals younger than 50 years, are among the largest subset of \\\\nearly-onset cancers globally. Treatment is similar to later-onset GI cancers and \\\\ntypically involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, \\\\ndepending on the cancer type and stage. The prognosis for patients with \\\\nearly-onset GI cancers is similar to or worse than that for patients with \\\\nlater-onset GI cancers, highlighting the need for improved methods of prevention \\\\nand early detection.\\\\n\\\\nDOI: 10.1001/jama.2025.10218\\\\nPMID: 40674064\",\"annotations\":null,\"meta\":null}\\n</observation>', '==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================\\n\\n**Updated Plan:**\\n1.
